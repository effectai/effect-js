## Adding tasks

Adding tasks to a campaign is done through <u>batches</u> batches are a collection of tasks that are added to a campaign. Each batch can contain multiple tasks.
Let's start by creating a batch with 3 tasks to our newly created image classification campaign.

```ts [example.ts]
import { createBatch } from '@effectai/effect-js'

const { actor } = client.session

const batch = await createBatch({
  client,
  batch: {
      campaign_id: '<..>', // the id of the campaign
      repetitions: 1 // number of times each task should be repeated
      payer: actor // the actor that will pay the workers for the tasks
  }
  data: [
    {
      image: 'https://example.com/image.jpg', //task 1 image placeholder
    },
    {
      image: 'https://example.com/image2.jpg', //task 2 image placeholder
    },
    {
      image: 'https://example.com/image3.jpg', // task 3 image placeholder
    }
  ]
})
```
