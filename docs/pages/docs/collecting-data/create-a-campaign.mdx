## Creating Your First Campaign

Campaigns are the main way to collect data on Effect Network.
A campaign is a <u>collection of tasks</u> that need to be completed by workers. Each task is a small piece of work that needs to be done. For example, a task could be to label an image, transcribe a piece of audio, or answer a question.
 They are created by the data requester (you) and contain information like the reward for the workers, the template for the tasks, the instructions for the workers etc.

### Creating a campaign

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/tasks/create-campaign.ts]

```

Wooooho! You have created your first campaign. You can now view the campaign on the [Effect Network](https://app.effect.network/campaigns) before you start collecting data, you need to add tasks to the campaign. You can do this by following the [Adding Tasks](/docs/collecting-data/adding-tasks) guide.
