## Creating Your First Campaign

Campaigns are the main way to collect data on Effect Network.
A campaign is a <u>collection of tasks</u> that need to be completed by workers. Each task is a small piece of work that needs to be done. For example, a task could be to label an image, transcribe a piece of audio, or answer a question.
 They are created by the data requester (you) and contain information like the reward for the workers, the template for the tasks, the instructions for the workers etc.

### Creating a campaign

```ts [example.ts]
import { createCampaign } from '@effectai/effect-js'

// get the actor from the session
const { actor } = client.session

// example template
const template = '<html>...</html>'

const campaign = await createCampaign({
  client,
  data: { 
      title: 'My first campaign',
      category: 'Image Labeling', // Category of the campaign e.g. Image Labeling, Audio Transcription etc.
      description: 'This is a description of my first campaign', // Description of the campaign
      estimated_time: 3600, // Estimated time to complete a task in seconds
      example_task: 'This is an example task',
      image: 'https://example.com/image.png',
      instructions: 'This is the instructions for the workers',
      input_schema: null,
      output_schema: null,
      template,
      version: 1,
  },
  campaign: {
    owner: actor,
    reward: { quantity: '1', contract: 'effecttokens' },
    max_task_time: 3600,
    qualis: [],
    payer: actor,
  },
})
```

Wooooho! You have created your first campaign. You can now view the campaign on the [Effect Network](https://app.effect.network/campaigns) before you start collecting data, you need to add tasks to the campaign. You can do this by following the [Adding Tasks](/docs/collecting-data/adding-tasks) guide.
