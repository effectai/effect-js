# Label Studio example

Here we will show an example of how to use [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/) to label images for object detection.

![Example](/labelstudioocr.png)

As discussed before we will be using the Label Studio to create a labeling task for object detection.
Here is an example of how to use Label Studio to create a labeling task for object detection.
We have some HTML  tags, that contain style sheets, the div that will be the container for Label Studio, library and scripts to initialize Label Studio.


## Template
```html
// [!include ~/snippets/templates/index.html]
```

## Input Schema

Note that you can also define the input and output schema for a given template.
This will allow you to define the structure of the data that will be used in the labeling task and the output that will be generated by the annotators.

{/* TODO figure out how to shorten this schema and make it more readable */}

```json
// [!include ~/snippets/templates/input_schema.json]
```
## Example output data

This is what the output data will look like after the annotators have labeled the images.

{/* TODO figure out how to shorten this example and make it more readable */}


```json
// [!include ~/snippets/templates/example.json]
```

## Script

You can use the following script to initialize Label Studio and create a labeling task for object detection.
This script uses [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/).

```typescript
// [!include ~/snippets/templates/script.ts]
```
