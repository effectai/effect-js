# Asset

## Description

Some functions with the `@effectai/sdk` package will return a `Asset` object. 
This object contains information about tokens on the blockchain and contain information such as the symbol, precision, and amount.

An example for the `Asset` object is as follows:


```json
{
  "precision": 4,
  "symbol": "EFX",
  "units": 10000,
  "value": 1
}
```
