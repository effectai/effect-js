# Transaction Result

## Description

Some functions with the `@effectai/sdk` package will return a `TransactionResult` object. 
This object contains the transaction hash and the transaction receipt.

The interface for the `TransactionResult` object is as follows:


```ts
interface TransactResult {
  chain: ChainDefinition
  request: SigningRequest
  resolved: ResolvedSigningRequest | undefined
  response?: { [key: string]: any }
  revisions: TransactRevisions
  signatures: Signature[]
  signer: PermissionLevel
  transaction: ResolvedTransaction | undefined
}
```
