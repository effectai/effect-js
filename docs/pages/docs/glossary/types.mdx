# Types [Glossary of Types in the effect sdk.]

## Campaign

[See Type](https://github.com/effectai/effect-js/blob/main/src/types/campaign.ts)

## Client Options 

The ClientOpts interface is used to define the options that can be passed to the EffectAI Client constructor.

```typescript
interface ClientOpts {
  ipfsCacheDurationInMs?: number | null;
  fetchProvider?: FetchProviderOptions;
  cacheImplementation?: Cache;
}
```

As we can see, the ClientOpts interface has three optional properties:

## `ipfsCacheDurationIMs`

This property is used to set the cache duration for the IPFS data. 
 The default value is 600_000 milliseconds; 10 minutes.

## `fetchProvider`

This property is used to set the fetch provider. 
This is needed because of the different runtimes availalbe to Java Script.
For example, in older versions of Node.js, the fetch API is not available. 
For older versions of Node.js, you can use the [`node-fetch` ](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch) package.

Since Node.js v18.0.0, the fetch API is available by default.

In the browser fetch is generally available, and is available on the `window.fetch` object.
You can read more about it here: [MDN Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)

Other serverside Java Script runtimes such as [Bun](https://bun.sh/) and (Deno)[https://deno.com/] already have fetch available on the global `fetch` object.

## `cacheImplementation`

This property is used to set the cache implementation.
There are three different cache mechanigms abailable in the EffectAI SDK.
First of all, "IDBCache", "LocalStorageCache", "MemoryCache".
Any of these can be passed to the `cacheImplementation` property while instanlizing the EffectAI Client.

```typescript
import { createClient, IDBCache, LocalStorageCache, MemoryCache } from '@effectai/sdk'
const client = createClient({
  cacheImplementation: new IDBCache() // or new LocalStorageCache() or new MemoryCache()
})
```

## Asset

### Description

Some functions with the `@effectai/sdk` package will return a `Asset` object. 
This object contains information about tokens on the blockchain and contain information such as the symbol, precision, and amount.

An example for the `Asset` object is as follows:


```json
{
  "precision": 4,
  "symbol": "EFX",
  "units": 10000,
  "value": 1
}
```

## Transaction Result

### Description

Some functions with the `@effectai/sdk` package will return a `TransactionResult` object. 
This object contains the transaction hash and the transaction receipt.

The interface for the `TransactionResult` object is as follows:


```ts
interface TransactResult {
  chain: ChainDefinition
  request: SigningRequest
  resolved: ResolvedSigningRequest | undefined
  response?: { [key: string]: any }
  revisions: TransactRevisions
  signatures: Signature[]
  signer: PermissionLevel
  transaction: ResolvedTransaction | undefined
}
```
