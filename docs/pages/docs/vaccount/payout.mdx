# payout

## Description

This function is used to claim the task reward that is locked in the escrow for the done tasks.
Every time a task is done, the reward is locked in the escrow until the timeout is reached.
After the timeout is reached, the reward can be claimed by the user who did the task.
The resulting EFX will be transferred to the user's EOS account on the blockchain.

The main difference between claim and payout, is where the funds are sent.
