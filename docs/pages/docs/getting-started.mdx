# Getting Started [Get started with the SDK in just a few lines of code.]

## Installation

Use your favorite package manager to install the SDK.
The sdk is available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@effectai/sdk)

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npm i @effectai/sdk
```

```bash [bun]
bun i @effectai/sdk
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm i @effectai/sdk
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Import and Instantiate the EffectAI Client

Here the handy dandy `createClient` function is used to create a client instance.
It can three arguments, the first one is the network configuration,
the second one is the a session object, and the third one is the options object.

In this quick start guide we will be focusing on the first two, 
how to get started with a non authenticated client using the network configuration and 
an authenticated client using the session object.

You can read more about the options object in the [ClientOptions](#client-options) section.

Here is an example of how to create a client with a network configuration.

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/getting-started/getting-started-init.ts]
```


### 2. Interact with the Client

The sdk is built using a stateless model, meaning that all the functions are pure 
and (almost) does not mutate the client object.
In practice this means that you wiil need to create a client object, 
and pass it as an argument to the functions you want to use.

Here is an example of how to retrieve an Effect account by using its ID.

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/getting-started/getting-started-nonauth.ts]
```

### 3. Set up wallet and session

If you want to make transactions, such as creating a new account, creating a new tasks, 
or transfering tokens, you need to set up a wallet and a session.
The wallet plugin is an interface that allows you to sign transactions and interact with the blockchain.

Currently the SDK does not come with any wallet plugins, 
and you will need to use one provided by [wharfkit.com](https://wharfkit.com/).
A list of plugins can be found at [wharfkit.com/plugins](https://wharfkit.com/plugins?sort=popular)

In this example we will use the [`@wharfkit/wallet-plugin-privatekey`](https://wharfkit.com/plugins/wallet-plugin-privatekey) plugin, which requres a private key to be passed in.

Afterwards we can set up the Session object, which allows us to specify other parameters like 
the actor, permission, and the blockchain netork.

Last but not least we connect the session to the client, and the client will be ready to use.

```ts twoslash
// [!include ~/snippets/getting-started/getting-started-auth.ts]
```

## Conclusion 

Now that we have a basic understaning of how to set up the client, we can move on to more advanced topics.
