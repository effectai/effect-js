## Quick Start

### 1. Import and Instantiate the EffectAI Client

:::code-group

```ts twoslash [EOS Testnet]
import {
	createClient,
	jungle4
} from "@effectai/sdk";

const client = await createClient({ network: jungle4 });
```

```ts twoslash [EOS Mainnet]
import {
	createClient,
	eos
} from "@effectai/sdk";

const client = await createClient({ network: eos });
```

:::

### 2. Using the client
```ts twoslash 
import {
	createClient,
	eos
} from "@effectai/sdk";
const client = await createClient({ network: eos });
// ---cut---
import {
	getCampaigns
} from "@effectai/sdk";

const campaigns = await getCampaigns({ client });
```

### 3. Authentication

Depending on your use case, you might need some sort of authentication with the EOS blockchain. Authentication is done through passing a [Wharfkit Session](https://wharfkit.com/kits/session). Read our guide on how to Authentication depending on your environment.


## What's next ? 

Now that we have a basic understanding of how to set up the client, we can move on to more advanced topics, like creating our first data collection campaign.
