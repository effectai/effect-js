# Why Effect AI

## Introduction

Effect AI was built to solve the problem of AI development.
It's a platform that connects AI developers with AI trainers to create data to train AI models.

## Problems

The problem that Effect AI is trying to solve is the lack of training data for AI models.
AI models are only as good as the data they are trained on.
The more data you have, the better the model will be.

There is an issue though that now we are facing, AI models are being trained with data that ws created by other AI models.
This is a problem because the data is not always accurate, the model will learn and exacerbate mistakes from the training data.
Leading to unreliable AI models.

## Solution

The soluiton is to create high quality training data.
This is where Effect AI comes in.

Effect AI is a platform that connects AI developers with AI trainers.

AI developers can post tasks that they need training data for.
Ai trainers can then complete these tasks and get paid for their work.
