# Getting Started [Get started with the SDK in just a few lines of code.]

## Overview

## Installation

Use your favorite package manager to install the SDK.

  :::code-group

  ```bash [npm]

  npm i @effectai/effect-js
  ```

  ```bash [bun]
  bun i @effectai/effect-js
  ```

  ```bash [pnpm]
  pnpm i @effectai/effect-js
  ```

## Quick Start

### 1. Import the SDK

```typescript
import { createClient } from '@effectai/sdk'
```

### 2. Instantiate the EffectAI Client

Here the handy dandy `createClient` function is used to create a client instance.
It takes two optional arguments, the first one is the network configuration, the second one is the options object.
You can read more about the options object in the [ClientOptions](#client-options) section.

```typescript
// This would be ideal, the big question is if using mainnet should be explicitly passed or not.
const client = createClient()

// But currently it is like this:
import { jungle4 } from '@effectai/sdk'
// Atleast the opts ({}) object is now optional
const client = createClient(jungle4)
```


### 3. Set up wallet and session

The SDK requires a wallet plugin to be set up.
The wallet plguin is an interface that allows you to sign transactions and interact with the blockchain.
The SDK comes with a few wallet plugins out of the box, but you can also create your own.

In this example we will use the `WalletPluginPrivateKey` plugin, which requres a private key to be passed in.

Afterwards we can set up the Session object, which allows us to specify other parameters like the actor, permission, and the blockchain netork.

Last but not least we connect the session to the client, and the client will be ready to use.

```typescript
// TODO These should also be re-exported from @effectai/sdk
import { Session } from "@wharfkit/session";
import { WalletPluginPrivateKey } from "@wharfkit/wallet-plugin-privatekey"

const walletPlugin = new WalletPluginPrivateKey("your_private_key_here")

const session = new Session({
    actor: "forcedev1234",
    permission: "active",
    walletPlugin,

    // Isn't this redundant, we're already passing this in the createClient function
    chain: {
      id: "73e4385a2708e6d7048834fbc1079f2fabb17b3c125b146af438971e90716c4d",
      url: "https://jungle4.greymass.com",
    },
})

// Connect the session to the client.
await session.setSession(session)
```

### 4. Interact with the Client

The sdk is built using a stateless model, meaning that all the functions are pure and do not mutate the client object.
This means, that you need to creat one client, and you can pass that client as an argument to functions to make transactions.

Here is an example of how to get the balance of an account, assuming that the client is already set up as described above.

```typescript
import { getVAccounts, getAccountById } from "../src/exports";
import { Name } from "@wharfkit/antelope";

const actor = Name.from("forcedev1234");
// Notice we are passing the clinet as an argument to the function.
const [vacc] = await getVAccounts({ client, actor });

console.log(vacc)
/**
{
  id: 24,                                                
  nonce: 0,
  address: [ "name", "forcedev1234" ],
  balance: {
    quantity: "0.0000 EFX",
    contract: "efxtoken1112",
  },
}
*/
```

Now that we have a basic understaning of how to set up the client, we can move on to more advanced topics.
